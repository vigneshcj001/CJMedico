# CJMedico

CJMedico is an innovative project integrating bioinformatics with Generative AI to generate artificial genes that rectify mutated genes. The focus of this project is cystic fibrosis (CF), using gene sequences from the NCBI database, which includes both mutated and healthy genes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage state-of-the-art AI models to alter mutated genes, creating artificial genes that can potentially replace defective sequences in real-time applications using CRISPR/Cas9. The process involves several key components and models, ensuring sequence uniformity and precision when altering mutated gene regions.

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - CF gene data (including both mutated and healthy genes) was obtained from the NCBI database.

2. **Autoencoder**: 
   - An Autoencoder was employed to transform healthy gene sequences into mutated ones. This step ensures that the sequence lengths remain consistent while preserving uniformity between healthy and mutated gene sequences. Only the mutated regions in the sequence are altered.

3. **Mutation Prediction with DNA BERT**: 
   - The DNA BERT model was used to predict the exact parts of the gene sequence that are mutated. DNA BERT provides highly accurate predictions by analyzing the nucleotide sequences and pinpointing the sections that require alteration.

4. **Artificial Gene Generation with GPT-2**: 
   - GPT-2 was used to generate artificial gene sequences from the predicted mutated gene regions. This ensures that the generated gene is tailored to replace only the defective parts of the sequence while keeping the rest of the gene intact.

5. **Gene and Biomarker Simulation with Prot BERT**: 
   - Prot BERT was utilized for simulating the interactions between the generated artificial genes and relevant biomarkers. This step ensures that the artificial gene will function correctly in biological contexts, especially when interacting with proteins.

### Real-Time Application

The artificial gene generated by this workflow can be applied in real-time by leveraging **CRISPR/Cas9** technology. CRISPR/Cas9 enables precise editing of DNA sequences, making it a perfect candidate for introducing the corrected, artificially generated gene into the target genome.

### Future Applications

While this project currently focuses on cystic fibrosis, the framework can be extended to other genetic diseases by modifying the gene sequences and models accordingly.
